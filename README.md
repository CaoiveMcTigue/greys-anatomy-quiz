# README for Grey's Anatomy Quiz

## Introduction
The sole purpose for this website was following a brief layout for my second milestone project, it was required I create an interacting webpage.

Being a big Grey's Anatomy fan. I decided to base a fun and inactive quiz around the tv show.

While doing this, I also wanted to display my new found JavaScript skills. The quiz is a fun way to test the users knowledge of the tv show Grey's Anatomy but the page and layout and is kept simply and clear for easy use to anyone.

## Features

When you load this Grey's Anatomy Quiz, you are met with the homepage. As mentioned above it is a simple and clear layout.

The Home page displays:

A navagation bar on top of the page containing four links and a logo.
* The Home link which redirects you to the homepage.
* The Quiz link which takes you to the start of the quiz ready to be played.
* The Leaderboard link that redirects you to the score board.
* The Fun Facts links to a page which has some facts about the tv show Grey's Anatomy giving the user some more information and a chance to learn more about the show.
* In the middle of these four buttons is a logo for the tv show Grey's Anatomy which is also a button which will redirect you to the Home page also.

There is a Grey's Anatomy hero image and some text beneath it. 

Then there is two buttons:
1. Play : which links to the quiz page to begin the game.
2. High Scores: which links to the leaderboard page to see the scores.

At the end of the page there is a footer displayed with two icons:
1. Instagram icon: links to my [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/keystrokescode/) page.
1. GitHub icon: links to my [GitHub](https://github.com/CaoiveMcTigue) page.

The quiz page is the main feature of this webpage. 

* You start at question one as expected, and move through ten questions. 
* The layout of these quiz questions are random so you will never have the same layout of questions. 
* In the top left hand corner of the quiz page a progress bar is displayed with the question you are on. e.g. Question 4 of 10.
* In the top right hand corner of the quiz page your score is displayed which increases by 100 points with every correct answer.

When you have the ten questions answered, you are redirected to a score page. Features here include:
* The same navagation bar as the homepage.
* A input text box to type your name to be displayed with users score.
* Underneath this is a save button, a try again button and a go home button.
* The Try Again button redirects you to the beginning of the quiz.
* The Go Home button redirects you to the home page again.
* The footer with the social media icons is displayed at the end of this page also.

I did not include this page in my nav bar as you have to complete the quiz for it to be of any use to the user.

The leaderboard page is a very simple HTML page which features:
* The navagation bar displayed in the other HTML pages.
* The heading "Leaderboard".
* Underneath the users name and score will display after the quiz is complete. 
* Then a Go Home button is displayed to redirect the user to the homepage.
* The footer with the social media icons is displayed at the end of this page also.

The Fun Facts page is the last page in this website. The features here include:
* The navagation bar displayed in the other HTML pages.
* The heading "Did You Know?".
* The facts are then displayed for reading.
* The footer with the social media icons is displayed at the end of this page also.

## Testing

## Technology
* I used HTML as my main language in this website and is used on all pages.
* I used CSS to style the website.
* I used JavaScript to create responsive code and linked it to the bottom of the HTML files it was needed in.
* I used GitHub to store my code and used Git push command to do so.
* Gitpod was used all the time for writing the code.
* Gitpages was used to deploy my site
* Google fonts was used to import fonts that look good and paired well together.
* Font Awesome was used to bring in icons which matched well with the page content.
* Linear-gradient, i used a converter online here and applied it to all my buttons in CSS. I think this looks really awesome and I will be using this again in future websites.

Also I would like to give credit to my mentor "Daisy", for the great advise and encouragement along the way.

JavaScript was a struggle for me at the start, completing this milestone project helped to put what I learned into action and lead me to have a much better understanding of Javascript in the long run.
